# Hackthebox - Forensics - TrueSecrets

### Our cybercrime unit has been investigating a well-known APT group for several months. The group has been responsible for several high-profile attacks on corporate organizations. However, what is interesting about that case, is that they have developed a custom command & control server of their own. Fortunately, our unit was able to raid the home of the leader of the APT group and take a memory capture of his computer while it was still powered on. Analyze the capture to try to find the source code of the server.

#### We're give a memory dump to analyse. I will use volatility2 to do so.

#### We need to determine what profile to use:

#### Running process list we see TrueCrypt app running.

#### Volatility has special plugins to grab info from TrueCrypt services.

#### $ python2 vol.py -f TrueSecrets.raw --profile=Win7SP1x86_23418 truecryptsummary

#### And get a password for  virtual encrypted disk by TrueCrypt, the disk seems to be stored in development.tc file.

#### Running filescan plugin we see a backup_develpment zip file !

#### Let's grab that with:
#### - $ python2 vol.py -f TrueSecrets.raw --profile=Win7SP1x86_23418 dumpfiles -Q 0x000000000bbf6158 --dump-dir dump
#### - cd dump && touch backup_development.zip
#### - mv *.dat backup_development.zip
#### - unzip it and we get the development.tc file

#### To inspect it we need to mount the disk file on a container, use the password we recovered earlier.

#### We go to our container and see some interesting stuff.

#### Inspecting the files we see some base64 strings but they seem to be encoded with some extra hash.

#### Inspecting the source code there is an encoding function that first encrypts the string using DES encryption then encode it in base64.

#### Let's bake the recipe with CyberChef.

####  And grab flag. ðŸ˜ˆ
